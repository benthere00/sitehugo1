Tips about algolia You need to upload index.json files to algolia to activate searching. You could upload the index.json files by browsers but a CLI tool may be better.

You can reference page resources by the value for Resources.GetMatch or the filepath of the resource relative to the page directory directly. Store resources in the assets directory, which is /assets by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the assets directory. Store resources in the static directory, which is /static by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the static directory. The priority of references is also in the above order. There are many places in the theme where the above local resource references can be used, such as links, images, image shortcode, music shortcode and some params in the front matter.

Set the property enable = true under [params.math] in your site configuration and the property math: true of the article front matter to enable the automatic rendering of mathematical formulas. $\\KaTeX$ automatically renders formulas based on specific delimiters. Tip Here is a list of $\\TeX$ functions supported by $\\KaTeX$. Note Since Hugo generates HTML documents according to the syntax such as _/*/\u003e\u003e when rendering Markdown documents, and some text content in the form of escape characters (such as \\(/\\)/\\[/\\]/\\\\) escape processing will be performed automatically, therefore, additional escape character expressions are required for these places to achieve automatic rendering: _ -\u003e \\_ * -\u003e \\* \u003e\u003e -\u003e \\\u003e\u003e \\( -\u003e \\\\( \\) -\u003e \\\\) \\[ -\u003e \\\\[ \\] -\u003e \\\\] \\\\ -\u003e \\\\\\\\ LoveIt theme supports raw shortcode to avoid these escape characters, which helps you write raw mathematical formula content. Example raw input: Inline Formula: Block Formula: The rendered output looks like this: Inline Formula: Block Formula: Inline Formula The default inline delimiters are: $ ... $ \\( ... \\) (escaped: \\\\( ... \\\\)) For example: $c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and \\\\(f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi\\\\) The rendered output looks like this: $c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and \\(f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi\\) Block Formula The default block delimiters are: $$ ... $$ \\[ ... \\] (escaped: \\\\[ ... \\\\]) \\begin{equation} ... \\end{equation} (unnumbered: \\begin{equation*} ... \\end{equation*}) \\begin{align} ... \\end{align} (unnumbered: \\begin{align*} ... \\end{align*}) \\begin{alignat} ... \\end{alignat} (unnumbered: \\begin{alignat*} ... \\end{alignat*}) \\begin{gather} ... \\end{gather} (unnumbered: \\begin{gather*} ... \\end{gather*}) \\begin{CD} ... \\end{CD} For example: $$ c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$ \\\\[ f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi \\\\] \\begin{equation*} \\rho \\frac{\\mathrm{D} \\mathbf{v}}{\\mathrm{D} t}=\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbb{P}+\\rho \\mathbf{f} \\end{equation*} \\begin{equation} \\mathbf{E}=\\sum_{i} \\mathbf{E}\\_{i}=\\mathbf{E}\\_{1}+\\mathbf{E}\\_{2}+\\mathbf{E}_{3}+\\cdots \\end{equation} \\begin{align} a\u0026=b+c \\\\\\\\ d+e\u0026=f \\end{align} \\begin{alignat}{2} 10\u0026x+\u00263\u0026y = 2 \\\\\\\\ 3\u0026x+\u002613\u0026y = 4 \\end{alignat} \\begin{gather} a=b \\\\\\\\ e=b+c \\end{gather} \\begin{CD} A @\u003ea\\\u003e\u003e B \\\\\\\\ @VbVV @AAcA \\\\\\\\ C @= D \\end{CD} The rendered output looks like this: $$ c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$ \\[ f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi \\] \\begin{equation*} \\rho \\frac{\\mathrm{D} \\mathbf{v}}{\\mathrm{D} t}=\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbb{P}+\\rho \\mathbf{f} \\end{equation*} \\begin{equation} \\mathbf{E}=\\sum_{i} \\mathbf{E}_{i}=\\mathbf{E}_{1}+\\mathbf{E}_{2}+\\mathbf{E}_{3}+\\cdots \\end{equation} \\begin{align} a\u0026=b+c \\\\ d+e\u0026=f \\end{align} \\begin{alignat}{2} 10\u0026x+\u00263\u0026y = 2 \\\\ 3\u0026x+\u002613\u0026y = 4 \\end{alignat} \\begin{gather} a=b \\\\ e=b+c \\end{gather} \\begin{CD} A @\u003ea\u003e\u003e B \\\\ @VbVV @AAcA \\\\ C @= D \\end{CD} Tip You can add more inline and block delimiters in your site configuration.

Note This article is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. If you want to know about the extended Markdown syntax of LoveIt theme, please read extended Markdown syntax page. Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

ECharts is a library helping you to generate interactive data visualization.

However, at the time of writing this, I couldn’t find any that worked. Particularly configuring Traefik as Proxy Server and Nginx as Web Server. So, I came up with a solution to redirect using Cloudflare since they offer 3 free page redirection rules. It’s a simple and effective way to do it, and you get the added benefit of using Cloudflare’s services. If you want to redirect non-www to www using Cloudflare, follow these step-by-step instructions: Log in to your Cloudflare account and select the domain you want to redirect. Click on the “Page Rules” tab. Click the “Create Page Rule” button. In the “If URL matches” field, enter your domain name without www, like example.com/*. Click the “Add a Setting” button and select “Forwarding URL”. Choose “301 - Permanent Redirect” from the dropdown menu. In the “Destination URL” field, enter https://www.example.com/$1. Click “Save and Deploy”. By following these steps, all traffic to your domain without the www prefix will be automatically redirected to the www version. I have done various things in both Traefik labels and its dynamic configurations, unfortunately I couldn’t find any thing useful as I prefer to make our code maintainable. It’s important to note that a 301 redirect is a permanent redirect and it’s preferred by search engines. By doing this, you’re telling search engines that your website has permanently moved to the www version of your domain, which can help improve your search engine rankings. That’s it! Now all traffic to your domain without the www prefix will be automatically redirected to the www version. Nice and clean right? Just comment below.
